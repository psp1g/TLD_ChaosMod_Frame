# The Long Drive Chaos Mod
For Twitch Integration - Forked from https://github.com/OfficiallyM/M_ChaosMod

* Modified M_ChaosMod.cs → GetActiveEffectName()
* Modified M_ChaosMod.cs → Update() → F2 to start/stop

# Improvements to do
* Sandstorm doesn't work because streamer has mods. Not sure why?

# Things we can add
* Spawn more things
* Change textures
* Flip vehicle
* Spawn a building
* Reverse vehicle
* Change the side the poles are on
* Change biome
